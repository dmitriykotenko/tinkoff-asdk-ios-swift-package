# Swift package for [Tinkoff Acquiring iOS SDK](https://github.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/tinkoff-asdk-ios)

Folders structure and project settings have been changed to build the project as swift package.

Asset-based images replaced by CoreGraphics-based images.

Localizable strings replaced by code-based texts.

Views with XIB-based layout were modified: layout now is created programmatically inside view initializer.

Otherwise, original code has not been changed.
